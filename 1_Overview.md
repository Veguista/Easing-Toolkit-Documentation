# Easing Toolkit - Overview

**Easing Toolkit** provides a range of tools for developers to ease changes in movement, rotation, scaling, and others in a procedural and configurable way.

It contains tools for procedurally easing changes in non-defined interpolations (interpolations where the endpoint is unknown).
They can be used to ease a player character's movement, to give personality to AI, or to polish game effects.

Additionally, it includes 30 basic [Easing Functions](https://easings.net/) that developers can apply to any interpolation with a single function.

**Easing Toolkit** is a Unity Package developed by Pablo Granado Valdivielso ("Veguista").
